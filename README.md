Notes:
The instruction of the challenge was to refactor a poorly written product API in C#. I was instructed that I am not constrained to .NET Framework and can completely rebuild it if I like. Therefore, I took the liberty of rebuilding the products API using the following technologies.
• Node Js
• Express Js
• Mongo DB
• Joi
• chai
• mocha
• supertest

Furthermore, I decided to build a simple front-end with React JS and make it a complete full-stack application. I have added this application to my private git repository and I have provided the git clone URL above under the instructions sections.
